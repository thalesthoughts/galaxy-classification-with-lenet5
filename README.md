## Galaxy Image Classification with Galaxy Zoo

This repository contains a galaxy image classification project using the Galaxy Zoo dataset of approximately 18,000 labeled galaxy images. The goal is to train a machine learning model that classifies galaxies into one of ten morphological categories based on their visual structure.

### Galaxy Categories

The dataset includes the following morphological classes:

- Disk, Face-on, No Spiral  
- Smooth, Completely Round  
- Smooth, In-between Round  
- Smooth, Cigar Shaped  
- Disk, Edge-on, Rounded Bulge  
- Disk, Edge-on, Boxy Bulge  
- Disk, Edge-on, No Bulge  
- Disk, Face-on, Tight Spiral  
- Disk, Face-on, Medium Spiral  
- Disk, Face-on, Loose Spiral  

### Project Overview

Given an input image of a galaxy, the model predicts its corresponding morphological category using learned visual features from the dataset. This project was undertaken both as a learning exercise and out of interest in Galaxy Zoo’s mission to better understand the structure, formation, and evolution of galaxies.

By applying machine learning techniques to astronomical image data, this work explores how automated morphological classification can contribute to large-scale efforts aimed at understanding the history and nature of our universe.
